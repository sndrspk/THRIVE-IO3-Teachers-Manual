# THRIVE IO3: Teachers' Manual

## Course description

This module covers 3 ECTS, including (interactive) classwork, homework and a teachersâ€™ manual. 1 ECTS correspondents to on average 28 hours of activity per student, including classes, homework and assessment/examination.

The module focusses on a wicked problem, presented by a client (cf. the value creation pedagogy, Lackeus, 2016). The students work in teams to propose a solution to the problem, using a typical design thinking / human-centered design methodology. In this module, this methodology is extended with literature and exercises focusing on three topics, that were found to be extremely relevant and lacking in many current entrepreneurship learning modules: motivation and perseverance, ethical and sustainable thinking, and team composition and complimentarity.
